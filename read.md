# ðŸš€ 100 Days of JavaScript â€“ Problem Solving Edition

Welcome to my **100 Days of JavaScript: Problem Solving Edition**. This challenge is all about solving **real coding problems**, **interview-level questions**, and **algorithmic exercises** using JavaScript â€” one day at a time.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To become **fluent in JavaScript** through continuous problem-solving. Every day, I will tackle a new question â€” from simple logic to more advanced algorithms â€” and commit both the code and explanation to this repository.

By the end of 100 days, I aim to:
- Build a strong problem-solving mindset
- Master JavaScript's built-in power and quirks
- Be interview-ready for coding rounds

## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Find Here

Each day covers a **unique problem**, such as:

- ðŸ§® Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- ðŸ”¢ Number problems (Armstrong number, Prime check, Fibonacci)
- ðŸ§µ Strings (Anagrams, Palindromes, Vowel counting)
- ðŸ“¦ Arrays (2nd largest, Rotate, Flatten, Intersection)
- ðŸ“Š Objects & Maps (Frequency count, Deep clone)
- ðŸŽ¯ Algorithms (Binary Search, Recursion, Sliding Window)
- ðŸ’¬ Common Interview Questions
- ðŸ”„ Recursion, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming
- ðŸŽ¯ Data structure simulation (Stacks, Queues, LinkedLists in JS)
